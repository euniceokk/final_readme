This is a Shiny app that analyzes the "sleep" dataset in R. The dataset includes data from a study looking at the effect of two different drugs on the sleep of participants. The app allows the user to choose between the two drugs or choose both. The user is then able to choose a type of visualization for their choice of data. If both data groups were chosen, the plot will visualize both groups and color code them for easy reading. The corresponding summary statistics are also presented!

Instructions:
1. Choose either drugs 1 or 2 or choose both.
2. If you wish to delete a drug, click the drug of choice and hit the backspace on your keyboard.
3. Select a visualization type.
4. Feel free to switch between visualization types and drugs!
